***I'm sorry for server interuptions during bug fixes***

-Games will have desyncs until updates are pushed.

-Account linking currently isnt working.

-Random disconnects.

-Desyncs with Ghost sometimes.

-Game froze with Parasite taking Copy Cat.

-Copy Cat Clone didn't apply skin

-After unlocking from team builder didn't unlock properly

-Mage swap Giant didn't knock-out (client side only, still functioned on server)

-Checker king forced move failed after capture (client reconnect fixes it)

-Battle Pass unlock failed to unlock until game restart

-Sometimes scale of characters are very large in pot (team builder) and take up the entire island making it all shadow. (you can back out of the team builder and it will fix)

-Sniper can shoot through Goop sometimes.

-Jester tutorial glitched sometimes.

-Giant tutorial glitched sometimes.

-Bot dificulty might be scaled improperly.
