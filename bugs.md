***I'm sorry for server interuptions during bug fixes***

-Poor performance on some mobile devices.

-Games will have desyncs until updates are pushed.

-Account linking currently isnt working.

-Random disconnects.

-Copy Cat Clone didn't apply skin

-After unlocking from team builder didn't unlock properly

-Checker king forced move failed after capture (client reconnect fixes it)

-Battle Pass unlock failed to unlock until game restart
