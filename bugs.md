***I'm sorry for server interuptions during bug fixes***

--Please report bugs via the Match History red exclamation mark button or if it isn't replay related to the Chess Ultimate discord! Thank you--

-There are so many bugs and its hard to maintain the list here. I'm working as hard as I can to fix them all ASAP!

-As for the "Someone logged into your account" bug you are not being hacked its just that your game holds the same connection id and a conflict arises. (hopefully will be fixed by june 18)
